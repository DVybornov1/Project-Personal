Programming is used in multiple other regions of science, such as biology, chemistry and physics.
Programming languages used in other fields of study are charecterised by said languages being highly presice in their calculations, oriented at completing complex mathematical operations visualising the resulting data.
There are Programming languages, created exlusively for scientific use, such as Julia, MATLAB or Fortan, but sometimes more common languages, such as Python or C++ can also be used.
