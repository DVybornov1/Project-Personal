Reports are created as .md files that are used to make .pdf and Microsoft Word files respectively. 
While creating a report, one should folow a certain bluprint that all .md report files start as.
Every report has multiple parts: the theme, the theory part, the list of tasks, the main part, the ending and the source list.
After the .md file is finished, the PDF and Word files are created using tthe "make" prompt.
